# 2DGaussianContourLevels
Calculates the contours of a two dimensional normal distribution of a desired amount of probability.
## Get Started
Start with the example_ellipse_prop.py file. In there only one function from contourlevels.py is called which generates the properties of the ellipses:
The semi-major axis, semi-minor axis and the angle of the ellipse w.r.t to the major axis.
The variable `cov` can be manipulated to any desired covariance matrix as long the mathmatical necessities are full filled.
